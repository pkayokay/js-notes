Components
Think of them as a collection of html css js and some internal data specific to that component
They have everything you need in a bundle, they are either pure js or JSXif done is jsx, we need to compile and convert the jsx to js.

Data is either received from a component's parent component, or it's contained in the component itself.
The 'state' of the data for itself and the children components live in the parent component.
We pass on the parent's data as an attribute for the children components to use this information
