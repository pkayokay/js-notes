// Components
// Think of them as a collection of html css js and some internal data specific to that component
// They have everything you need in a bundle, they are either pure js or JSXif done is jsx, we need to compile and convert the jsx to js.

// Data is either received from a component's parent component, or it's contained in the component itself.
// The 'state' of the data for itself and the children components live in the parent component.
// We pass on the parent's data as an attribute for the children components to use this information
